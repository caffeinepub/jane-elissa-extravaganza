# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the FAQ entry titled “What are the terms and conditions?” from the /faqs page.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete the “What are the terms and conditions?” accordion item from the FAQs data/rendering used on the /faqs route.
- Ensure the Terms & Conditions section does not render an empty/blank accordion item after the removal.

**User-visible outcome:** On /faqs, the “What are the terms and conditions?” question no longer appears, and the remaining FAQ sections/items display normally without errors.
