# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a professional, prestigious marketing website for the “Jane Elissa Extravaganza” music competition, including an application flow with video submission and a 75 CAD payment step, plus FAQs and cause/impact messaging.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a consistent premium visual theme (refined typography, formal layout, high-contrast palette with gold accents) across the site.
- Add core pages with navigation: Home (clear prize messaging), Apply (form + payment step), FAQs (professional Q/A layout).
- Implement the Apply form with required contact fields (full name, email) and video submission via either file upload or YouTube link (exactly one required), with success confirmation.
- Persist submitted applications in the backend with contact info, submission method, video reference, timestamp, and payment status/details (non-sensitive reference).
- Add a backend query to list applications (newest first) including key fields and payment status.
- Add cause/impact messaging that application fees support leukemia and cancer research.
- Add and use custom static brand images (logo/crest, hero/banner, background pattern) as frontend static assets.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can learn about the competition and prize, read FAQs, and apply by submitting their details and a video (upload or YouTube link) while completing a 75 CAD payment step; applicants see a clear submission confirmation.
