# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the FAQs page content to reflect the latest submission instructions, video time limit guidance, and the 2026 competition timeline.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the FAQ answer for “How do I submit my performance?” to instruct users to go to the Apply page, tap the external application link, and complete the form.
- Update the FAQ answer for “What should my video include?” to state the suggested time limit is around 2–4 minutes (removing the previous 3–10 minutes guidance).
- Add/adjust FAQ content to state: application deadline is August 1st, 2026; winners announced via email on September 1st, 2026; performance will be mid November in Times Square.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the FAQs page see updated, accurate instructions for submitting an application, updated video length guidance, and the correct 2026 deadline/announcement/performance timeline in the existing accordion UI.
