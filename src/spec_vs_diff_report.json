  "summary": "Most requested marketing site and application/payment flow appear implemented: Home/Apply/FAQs navigation, prestigious theme, FAQ accordion, static generated brand images usage, Stripe checkout with success/failure pages, and backend application persistence with an admin-oriented listing method. However, the diff introduces explicit admin/access-control and user-profile features that were not requested (and were called out as non-goals). Some backend acceptance criteria (newest-first ordering in the admin list) cannot be fully verified due to backend truncation.",
